Tabulated OCR

This is my final year project. Files in this repositories are the codes that I wrote (except the auto-generated GUIs and Hibernate config file). I didn't include the library files, which are: Hibernate, MySQL Java Connector, OpenCV, Tess4j (Tesseract Wrapper for Java)

The idea behind the project was to free companies from entering tones of data manually. That kind of job is boring and stressing. Knowing that datas mostly come from paper documents that have predefined format, one can give a format, recognize texts from the scan of the document and extracts useful data.
